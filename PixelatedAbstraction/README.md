# Select Selection Colorrange
An attempt to make a plugin based on Pixelated Abstraction [(Timothy Gerstner, et al. 2012)](https://cragl.cs.gmu.edu/pixelate/)

After several attempts, I decided C# (and especially the stripped down, libraryless C# used in PDN CodeLab) is not the medium to do this in. I may return to this some day, but for now, I'm retiring this attempt :/
