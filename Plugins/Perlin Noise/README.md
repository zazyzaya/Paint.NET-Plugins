# Perlin Noise Generator
Just generates Perlin noise given user specifications. I couldn't help but notice that there are many PDN plugins that *utilize* Perlin noise, but none so far as I could tell, that generate it. Well, that's what this does. It's not glamorous, but it's necessary for lots of other cool stuff, so here you go.

### TODO
* As of right now, this is a working version, however all objects are just that: objects. I need to rewrite parts of this to use pointers so it's less of a memory drain.
* Color the noise based on user input
